# Contributing to Scalax

The Scalax project welcomes contributions from anybody wishing to
participate.  All code or documentation that is provided must be
licensed with the same license that Scalax is licensed with (Apache
License 2.0, see [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) file) and all authors
must agree to
[Scala's Contributor License Agreement](https://www.typesafe.com/contribute/cla/scala).

## Code of Conduct

People are expected to follow the
[Typelevel Code of Conduct](http://typelevel.org/conduct.html) when
discussing Scalax on the Github page, Gitter channel, or other venues.

We hope that our community will be respectful, helpful, and kind. If
you find yourself embroiled in a situation that becomes heated, or
that fails to live up to our expectations, you should disengage and
contact one of the project maintainers in private. We hope to avoid
letting minor aggressions and misunderstandings escalate into larger
problems.

## License Agreement

Given that the purpose of Scalax is to incorporate some of the work in
Scala's standard library by means of the
[SLIP](https://gitter.im/scala/slip) process, all contributors to
Scalax must sign the
[Scala's Contributor License Agreement](https://www.typesafe.com/contribute/cla/scala),
which represents a copyright and patent agreement between the
individual contributors and EPFL. Read the
[document](https://www.typesafe.com/contribute/cla/scala/current).

The aforementioned copyright and patent agreement is represented by
the addition of a line to the [CONTRIBUTORS.txt](./CONTRIBUTORS.txt)
file. For a pull request to be considered every contributor must have
signed Scala's CLA both by following the
[instructions](https://www.typesafe.com/contribute/cla/scala) and by
including a line in the CONTRIBUTORS file. This may be included within
that same pull request.

## General Workflow

1. Make sure you can license your work under the BSD 3-Clause license
   and that you can sign Scala's Individual Contributor License
   Agreement (see above)

2. Before starting to work, make sure there is a ticket in the issue
   or create one first. It can help accelerate the acceptance process
   if the change is agreed upon

3. If you don't have write access to the repository, you should do
   your work in a local branch of your own fork and then submit a pull
   request. If you do have write access to the repository, never work
   directly on master.

4. When the work is completed, submit a Pull Request.

5. Anyone can comment on a pull request and you are expected to
   answer questions or to incorporate feedback.

6. It is not allowed to force push to the branch on which the pull
   request is based.

## General Guidelines

1. It is recommended that the work is accompanied by unit tests.

2. The commit messages should be clear and short one lines, if more
   details are needed, specify a body.

3. New source files should be accompanied by the copyright header.

4. Follow the structure of the code in this repository and the
   indentation rules used.

5. Your first commit request should be accompanied with a change to
   the CONTRIBUTORS.txt file, adding yourself to the contributors list
   and signing Scala's Individual Contributor License Agreement
